- Redesigned `lib/src/citizen/home_citizen.dart` to match the layout of `HomeGovernment`.
- Added a feature card/button for Announcements that navigates to PostsScreen filtered for announcements.
- Modified `lib/src/screens/posts_screen.dart` to support an `initialFilter` parameter for direct navigation to Announcements.
- Updated Announcements button in HomeCitizen to use this filter.
- HomeCitizen now only shows feature cards (e.g., Announcements, Recent Posts) and does not show posts by default. Navigation to posts/announcements is via the feature cards.
- PostsScreen now includes a back button in the AppBar when navigated to, allowing users to return to the home page.
- Added `lib/src/services/notification_service.dart` for Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) integration.
- Integrated notification sending in `posts.service.dart` (for announcements and polls) and `advertisement_service.dart` (for accepted ads).
- Notifications are triggered to all users when a government admin creates an announcement, poll, or accepts an ad request.
- Integrated authentication in notification_service.dart:
  - FCM token is now saved to Firestore under the authenticated user's document using FirebaseAuth.
  - Added error handling for unauthenticated users.
  - Fixed onTokenRefresh to use instance access (_fcm.onTokenRefresh).
- Fixed sendNotificationToAll usage in posts.service.dart to use positional arguments for title and body, matching NotificationService signature.
